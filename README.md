# Cancer-Predection-SVM-
In this program a data of cancer cell description is taken.the data is split in to train test for the model
the using sklearn the SVM model is implimented using the train data
the  the success of the model is tested using the test data splitted before
then cross validtion is done to  check the avg score of the model
** a knn model is also created with the data to show SVM always gives the better result even if it takes longer to proccess
atlast grid search is implimented to find the best parameters for the SVM model for our data
